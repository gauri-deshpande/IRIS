# IRIS FLOWER CLASSIFICATION
data science
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying iris flower species (setosa, versicolor, and virginica) based on their measurements. By analyzing the dataset and training a model, the project enables accurate classification of iris flowers, contributing to understanding and identifying different species using machine learning techniques.
